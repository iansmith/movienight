*** Do it in s5?

* Fix the seven5 buildpack on Heroku to do the build of the client side assets and code
** Remove all the commited "outputs" from the github repo (source)

* Sign up page
** So you don't have to do create_acct for every person, maybe filter on email suffix?

** The scaffolding is in pwd_auth.go for this already
** DB tables are not there though

* Ability to set a picture for your user profile
** It's nice to convert it to a round image using the draw library of go
